  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/
    - assets/icon/
    - assets/gifs/
  fonts:
    - family: Lugrasimo
      fonts:
        - asset: assets\fonts\Lugrasimo\Lugrasimo-Regular.ttf
    - family: Crimson
      fonts:
        - asset: assets\fonts\Crimson_Text\CrimsonText-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets\fonts\Crimson_Text\CrimsonText-Bold.ttf
          weight: 900
        - asset: assets\fonts\Crimson_Text\CrimsonText-BoldItalic.ttf
          weight: 900
          style: italic
        - asset: assets\fonts\Crimson_Text\CrimsonText-Italic.ttf
          style: italic
        - asset: assets\fonts\Crimson_Text\CrimsonText-SemiBold.ttf

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
